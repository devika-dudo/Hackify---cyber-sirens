# Hackify---cyber-sirens
This is a repository for the hackathon we are attending - hackify conducted at MACE.
Problem Statement: Despite the critical need for comprehensive care in palliative settings, only 14% of patients receive adequate healthcare due to challenges in identifying and addressing invisible symptoms such as delirium, anxiety, and others. This gap in care leads to a significant portion of patients experiencing unnecessary suffering and diminished quality of life. Moreover, the immense emotional burden placed on caregivers often goes unrecognized and unsupported, making it worse for their own mental health struggles and further compromising the quality of care provided.

Business Strategy: Our strategy includes leveraging SEO optimization, social media, email marketing, partnerships with healthcare organizations, event participation, press releases, and media coverage to maximize reach and impact. The low-cost caregiver forum will generate revenue through subscription fees for premium features. Additionally, we will monetize anonymized patient data for research, ensuring compliance with data privacy regulations and obtaining patient consent. Key metrics will be used to measure performance, and insights will drive iterative refinements to our approach. This business plan outlines our commitment to innovation, accessibility, and ethical data practices in the palliative care sector.

Bedridden patients and those requiring palliative care often struggle to articulate their symptoms due to the absence of verbal communication. To address this issue, our project focuses on developing a web-based platform that utilizes machine learning, particularly multimodal AI integration which sees to the use of images, audio, etc as parameters, to predict both physical and mental health symptoms in palliative care patients. Healthcare professionals and caregivers can input patient information, including visible symptoms, and receive predictions for the non-visible symptoms that are aligned with these visible symptoms- such as delirium, anxiety, and many more. Additionally, healthcare workers can contribute additional data to enhance model accuracy. Predicting invisible symptoms allows healthcare providers to intervene early, potentially preventing the exacerbation of symptoms (like the development of pressure ulcers) and improving patient outcomes.
Furthermore, we are committed to creating a supportive online community forum for caregivers. This forum will serve as a vital resource, providing caregivers with a platform to seek guidance, share experiences, and access valuable support networks. Our vision extends beyond technological innovation; we aim to create a holistic ecosystem that addresses the needs of both patients and caregivers alike.
